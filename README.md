This repository contains implementations of two simple machine learning models for spam email detection: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier and the Naive Bayes classifier.

Feature Vectorization: Uses DictVectorizer to convert processed email data into numerical features.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier:
- Supports L1 (Manhattan), L2 (Euclidean), and Linfty (Chebyshev) distance metrics.
- Predicts email class and evaluates model accuracy.

Naive Bayes Classifier:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes for spam detection.
- Estimates parameters, predicts classes, and evaluates model accuracy.
